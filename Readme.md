FritzControl .NET6

An experimental code to enable or disable static routes in a Fritzbox

Tested on the Fritzbox 7590 AX

No new routes can be created or deleted (but possible after adapting the code)

The code itself is not the nicest, serves more as a prototype to demonstrate the functionality. For practical use you should also not use the deprecated WebClient, but rather rely on HttpRequest
